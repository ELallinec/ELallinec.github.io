I am a 2nd year PhD student under the supervision of [Antoine Levitt](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~antoine.levitt/) in the Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay ([LMO](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/)) of Paris Saclay University in France. 

My full CV is available [here](/cv.pdf).

# Research Interest

I study numerical methods and more especially numerical integration methods used in both material sciences and quantum chemistry. 

### Some Keywords
* Numerical Analysis
* Quantum Mechanics
* Linear Algebra
* Complex Analysis

## Some notes 
Here are some notes that I wrote and that might be useful to some people. 

* [Small notes](/lt.pdf) about Linear Tetrahedron method.

## Programming

A main part of my work is to implement and test numerical methods for the computation of electronic properties.
To do so I use [Julia](https://julialang.org/). 

Here are some packages I contributed to 
* AutoBZCore.jl (implementation of 2 numerical methods for DOS computation)
* ImplicitIntegration.jl
