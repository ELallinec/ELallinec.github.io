Hi and welcome on my website! I'm Ewen, a third-year PhD student under the supervision of [Antoine Levitt](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~antoine.levitt/) in the Laboratoire de MathÃ©matiques d'Orsay ([LMO](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/)) of Paris Saclay University. 

My full CV is available [here](/en/cven.pdf).

# Research Interest
I am deeply interested in numerical methods, particularly those with applications in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. In particular, I study Brillouin zone integration and the special case of the density of states (DOS).

### Some Keywords
* Numerical Analysis
* Quantum Mechanics
* Linear Algebra
* Complex Analysis

# Some Notes
Here are some notes I wrote that might be useful to others:
* [Small notes](/lt.pdf) on the Linear Tetrahedron method for DOS computation in 1D, 2D, and 3D.

# Programming
A major part of my work involves implementing and testing numerical methods for computing electronic properties using [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

Here are some packages I have contributed to:
* **AutoBZCore.jl** â€“ Implementation of two numerical methods for DOS computation.
* **ImplicitIntegration.jl** â€“ Better bounds for the eigenvalues of Hamiltonians.
